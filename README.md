# FVCP-Property-API
Sample application originally designed for a presentation on RESTful Web Services to the Fox Valley Computing Professionals.  Makes use of Web API, Castle Windsor IOC, and an enterprise architecture based on SOLID principles.  Entity Framework was used for persistence, but the design permits that to be changed with minimal effort.
